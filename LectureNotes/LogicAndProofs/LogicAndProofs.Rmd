# Introduction

In this lecture we review the main logical rules in mathematics. 

## Topics to Cover

- The idea of a statement and  truth value 
- Deductive Reasoning vs. Inductive Reasoning
- Logical Connectives
- Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive of a Statement
- Necessity and Sufficiency
- Quantifiers
- Mathematical Proof

---

# Statement and truth value 

- A **statement** is an assertion that is either **true** or **false** or **open**. 
- If a **statement** is ***true*** we say that its truth value is "True" (T). Similarly, a
false statement has truth value "False" (F). Otherwise, if we cannot decide whether it is ***true*** or ***false*** we can conclude that it has truth value ***Open*** (O).

> **QUESTION:**  What is the difference between a **statement** and a **proposition**?

## Examples

- Ankara is the capital city of Turkey
- $(x + y)^{2} = x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2}$
- NAFTA is a trade agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. 
- All cats are white
-  All prime numbers are odd numbers.
- $x > y$
- $x^{2} - 9 = 0$

---

# Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning

Logical reasoning can be classified as either deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning.

- **Deductive Reasoning:**  Reasoning based on consistent rules of logic. 

*Examples* : The cardinality of the real numbers be greater than that of the rational numbers. 

- **Inductive Reasoning:**  Reasoning based based on a set of observations. 

*Examples* : Auroras are formed when solar particles interact with the Earth’s magnetic field.


> **QUESTION:** Why inductive reasoning is not recognized as a form of proof in mathematics?

# Logical Connectives


- In logic, **logical connectives** (also called sentential connective, or sentential operator) are **operations** on statements which change their truth values or combine them to produce new statements.


## List of common logical connectives

- Negation (not): $\neg$
- Conjunction (and): $\land$
- Disjunction (or): $\lor$
- implication (if $\dots$ then): $\implies$
- Biconditional (if and only if): $\iff$

---

# Logical Connectives

Let $p$ be a statement. Then the statement " $p$ is **false**." is called the **negation** of $p$ and denoted by $\neg p$. The operation can be illustrated by a truth table:


| p     	|  $\neg p$ |
|-------	|-------	  |
| True  	| False 	  |
| False 	| True      |

## Example

- If  $p$ is “Today is Monday”, then $\neg p$ means “Today is not Monday”.
- if $p$ is $x \nless 2$ then $\neg p$ means $x \geq 2$


Let  $p$ be a statement. Then  $\neg(\neg p)$  is logically equivalent to $p$. More precisely $(\neg(\neg p)) \iff p$.

> **QUESTION:** Find $\neg p$ for $p :=(\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \exists n \in \mathbb{Z}, x<n)$.


---

# Logical Connectives

Let $p$ and $q$ be statements. Then,  "*Both a and b are true.*"  is called a **conjunction** and denoted by $p \land q$. The operation can be illustrated by a truth table:


| $p$    | $q$     | $p \land q$ |
|-------|-------|---------   |
| True  | True  | True       |
| False | True  | False      |
| True  | False | False      |

## Example

- The Moon revolves around the Earth and elephant can fly.
- $(x \leq 2) \land (x \geq 1) \iff 1 \leq x \leq 2$
- $x \land y \in \mathbb{R}$ is wrong. Why?
> **QUESTION:** Determine the truth values of the following statements.
> $(\sqrt{30} > 5) \land (\sqrt{30} < 7)$

---

# Logical Connectives

“*Either a or b (or both) is true.*” is called a **disjunction** and denoted by $p \lor q$. 


| p     | q     | $p \lor q$ |
|-------|-------|---------|
| True  | True  | True    |
| False | True  | True    |
| True  | False | True    |
| False | False | False   |


## Example

- $0 \leq 1$ contains $(0 < 1) \lor (0 = 1)$. 

- $\left(4^{2}-5^{2} \leq 0\right) \lor \left(\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}=3+4\right)$

---

# More compound statements

let $p, q$, and $r$ be simple statements. Please provide truth tables of following statements:

- $(p \lor q) \land r$
- $p \lor (q \land r)$
- $(\neg p) \lor (\neg q)$
- $(p \lor q) \land (\neg r)$


---
# Logical Connectives

“*If $p$ is true, then so is $q$.*” is called an **implication** and denoted by $p \implies q$.

- The order of $p$ and $q$ is not important in conjunction and disjunction. That is, $p \land q$ is the same as $q \land p$. 
- This is not true for an implication, which is written as “If **p then q”**, and denoted by $p \implies q$. 
- The statement $p$ is called the **hypothesis** and $q$ the **conclusion**. 
- Implication is also called a conditional statement.

## Example

- $x$ is the healthy person $\implies x$ is breathing.  
- $x > 0 \implies x^2 > 0$
- $xy = 0 \implies (x = 0) \lor (y = 0) \lor both$


> **QUESTION:** $x^2 > 0 \implies x > 0 ?$

---

# Logical Connectives

If the statement $p \implies q$ and its converse $q \implies q$ are both true, we have i.e. $p$ is **equivalent** to $q$, or $p$ *if and only if * $q$.  

- That is, $p \implies q \land q \implies p$, which has a shorthand notation $p \iff q$. 

## Example

- $\left.\begin{array}{ll}p: xy = 0 \\ q: (x = 0) \lor (y = 0) \end{array}\right\} xy = 0 \iff (x = 0) \lor (y = 0)$


- $\left.\begin{array}{ll}p: x > 0 \\ q: x^3 > 0 \end{array}\right\} x > 0 \iff x^3 > 0$

---

# Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive

Let $p \implies q$ be  a conditional statement. Then
- $q \implies p$ is the converse, 
- $\neg p \implies \neg q$ is the inverse,
- $\neg q \implies \neg p$ is the contrapositive of the $p \implies q$.

## Example

- If it is a whole number, then it is an integer. $(p \implies q)$
- If it is an integer, then it is a whole number. $(q \implies p)$
- If it is not a whole number, then it is not an integer. $(\neg p \implies \neg q)$
- If it is not an integer, then it is not a whole number. $(\neg q \implies \neg p)$ 


---

# Tautology

A proposition is *tautology* if its truth table contains only true values for every case. 

Consider following statement: "*I will either get paid or not get paid.* then we can represent it using $p$ and $\neg  p$ as
- $p$: I will get paid. 
- $\neg  p$: I will not get paid.


| p     | $\neg p$     | $p \lor \neg p$ |
|-------|-------|---------|
| True  | False | True    |
| False | True  | True    |


**QUESTION:** $((p \land q) \implies r) \iff (p \implies (q \implies r))$ is tautology?

---

# Necessity and Sufficiency

In logic, *necessity* and *sufficiency* are terms used to describe a **conditional** or **implicational** relationship between two statements.
- A *necessary* condition is expressed by the conclusion.
- A *sufficient* condition is expressed by the hypothesis. 

>Suppose $p \implies q$ is true. Then
- *p* is called sufficent for *q*
- *q* is called necessary for *p*

##### Example

- Any number that is divisible by $6$ is also divisible by $3$.


Suppose $(p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)$ then $p$ and $q$ are *sufficient* and *necessary* for each other.

##### Example

- Any number that  is divisible by  $6$  is also divisible by $3$ and $2$.

# De Morgan's laws for logic

#### Commutativity

- $p \lor q \iff q \lor p$
- $p \land q \iff q \land p$

#### Associativity

- $p \lor q \lor r \iff (p \lor q) \lor r$ or $p \lor (q \lor r)$
- $p \land q \land r \iff (p \land q) \land r$ or $p \land (q \land r)$

#### Idempotency

- $p \land p \iff p$
- $p \lor p \iff p$

#### Distributivity

- $p \lor (q \land r) \iff (p \lor q) \land (p \lor r)$
- $p \land (q \lor r) \iff (a \land q) \lor (p \land r)$

---

# De Morgan's laws for logic

1) Complement of the union equals the intersection of the complements. 
- $\neg(p \lor q) \iff \neg p \land \neg q$ 

2) Complement of the intersection equals the union of the complements
- $\neg(p \land q) \iff \neg p \lor \neg q$

> **QUESTION:** Please proof the first De Morgan's law using truth table. 


---

# Quantifiers

**Quantifiers** are words, expressions, or phrases that indicate the number of elements that a statement pertains to. 
- In mathematical logic, there are two quantifiers: '*there exists*' and '*for all*'.
- Suppose a *propositional function* $p(x)$ that is a statement involving a variable $x$. For instance $p(x): 2x$ is an even integer. 
- Also suppose $x$ is element of a set $D$. For example x is an element of the set of integers. Then $D$ can be called as the *domain* of $p(x)$. 
- We can write $p(x)$ *for all* $x$ in a domain $D$. 

#### Example

- $\forall x \in \mathbb{R} \ni x^{2} \geq 0$
- $\forall n \in \mathbb{N} \ni \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

So $\forall$ is called the *universal quantifier*. 

---

# Quantifiers

For some $x \in D,  p(x)$ is true if there *exists* an element $x$ in the domain $D$ for which $p(x)$ is true. 

#### Example
- In introduction part,  we claim that $x^{2} - 9 = 0$ is not a statement. So, we can turn it into a statement by adding a quantifier. $\exists x \in \mathbb{R} \ni x^{2} - 9 = 0$. 
- $\exists x \in \mathbb{R} \ni x^{2} = 25$
- $\exists! x \in \mathbb{N} \ni x^{2} = 25$

So $\exists$ and $\exists!$ are called the *existential quantifier*. 

---

# Mathematical Proof

A mathematical system consists of

- Undefined terms 
- Definations
- Postulates/Axioms.

*Undefined terms* are the basic building blocks of a mathematical system.
- These are words that are accepted as starting concepts of mathematical system. 

#### Example
- *Point* or *Line* in Euclidean geometry. 

*Defination* is a proposition constructed from undefined terms and previously accepted concepts. 

#### Example
- Two lines are *parallel* if they never meet.


---

# Mathematical Proof

*Postulates/Axioms* These are basic facts about undefined terms. The simpler and more fundamental they are, the better. 
#### Example
- “Every pair of points determines a line”, or “if $x = y$, then $y = x$.”

*Theorems* These are the statements that make mathematics what it is -they are facts that we prove using axioms, definitions, and theorems that we’ve proved earlier. (Propositions, Lemmas, Corollaries are all species of theorems.)
- A theorem is a proposition of the form $p \implies q$ 

#### Example
- All right angles have the same measure, namely $90^{\circ}$.

---

# Mathematical Proof

A *lemma* is a small theorem which is used to prove a bigger theorem. 

#### Example
- **Euclid's lemma**: If $a$ prime $p$ divides the product $ab$ of two integers $a$ and $b$, then $p$ must divide at least one of those integers $a$ and $b$.

A *corollary* is a theorem that can be proven to be a logical consequence of another theorem. 

#### Example

- If the three sides of a triangle have aqual lenght, then its angles also have equal measure. 


---

# Mathematical Proof

A *proof* is a logical argument that consist of a series of steps using propositions in such a way that the truth of the theorem is established. 

## Type of mathematical proofs

Suppose that you want to proof the statement $p \implies q$:

- **Direct Proof**: A direct method of attack that assumes the truth of proposition $p$ axioms and proven theorems so that the truth of proposition $q$ is obtained. 

- **Proof by Contrapositives**: Proof by contrapositive is a rule of inference used in proofs, where one infers a conditional statement from its contrapositive. In other words, $(p \implies q) \iff [(\neg p) \implies (\neg q)]$.
