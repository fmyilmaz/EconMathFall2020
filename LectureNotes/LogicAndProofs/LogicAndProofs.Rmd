# Introduction

In this lecture we review the main logical rules in mathematics. 

## Topics to Cover

- The idea of a statement and  truth value 
- Deductive Reasoning vs. Inductive Reasoning
- Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive of a Statement
- Necessity and Sufficiency
- Mathematical Proof

# Statement and truth value 

- A **statement** is an assertion that is either **true** or **false** or **open**. 
- If a **statement** is ***true*** we say that its truth value is "True" (T). Similarly, a
false statement has truth value "False" (F). Otherwise, if we cannot decide whether it is ***true*** or ***false*** we can conclude that it has truth value ***Open*** (O).

## Examples

- Ankara is the capital city of Turkey
- $(x + y)^{2} = x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2}$
- NAFTA is a trade agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. 
- All cats are white
-  All prime numbers are odd numbers.
- $x > y$
- $x^{2} - 9 = 0$
