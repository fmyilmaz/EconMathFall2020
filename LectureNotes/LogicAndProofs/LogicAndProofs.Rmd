# Introduction

In this lecture we review the main logical rules in mathematics. 

## Topics to Cover

- The idea of a statement and  truth value 
- Deductive Reasoning vs. Inductive Reasoning
- Logical Connectives
- Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive of a Statement
- Necessity and Sufficiency
- Mathematical Proof

# Statement and truth value 

- A **statement** is an assertion that is either **true** or **false** or **open**. 
- If a **statement** is ***true*** we say that its truth value is "True" (T). Similarly, a
false statement has truth value "False" (F). Otherwise, if we cannot decide whether it is ***true*** or ***false*** we can conclude that it has truth value ***Open*** (O).

> **QUESTION:**  What is the difference between a **statement** and a **proposition**?

## Examples

- Ankara is the capital city of Turkey
- $(x + y)^{2} = x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2}$
- NAFTA is a trade agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. 
- All cats are white
-  All prime numbers are odd numbers.
- $x > y$
- $x^{2} - 9 = 0$

# Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning

Logical reasoning can be classified as either deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning.

- **Deductive Reasoning:**  Reasoning based on consistent rules of logic. 

*Examples* : The cardinality of the real numbers be greater than that of the rational numbers. 

- **Inductive Reasoning:**  Reasoning based based on a set of observations. 

*Examples* : Auroras are formed when solar particles interact with the Earth’s magnetic field.


> **QUESTION:** Why inductive reasoning is not recognized as a form of proof in mathematics?

# Logical Connectives


- In logic, **logical connectives** (also called sentential connective, or sentential operator) are **operations** on statements which change their truth values or combine them to produce new statements.


## List of common logical connectives

- Negation (not): $\neg$
- Conjunction (and): $\land$
- Disjunction (or): $\lor$
- implication (if $\dots$ then): $\implies$
- Biconditional (if and only if): $\iff$

# Logical Connectives

Let $p$ be a statement. Then the statement " $p$ is **false**." is called the **negation** of $p$ and denoted by $\neg p$. The operation can be illustrated by a truth table:


| p     	|  $\neg p$ |
|-------	|-------	  |
| True  	| False 	  |
| False 	| True      |

## Example

- If  $p$ is “Today is Monday”, then $\neg p$ means “Today is not Monday”.
- if p is $x \nless 2$ then $\neg p$ means $x \geq 2$


Let  $p$ be a statement. Then  $\neg(\neg p)$  is logically equivalent to $p$. More precisely $(\neg(\neg p)) \iff p$.
